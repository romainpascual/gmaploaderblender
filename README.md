# gmaploaderblender

## Description

Load G-maps in Blender from [Jerboa](http://xlim-sic.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/jerboa/doc/) through the JeMoTransmitter (i.e., a server).

A hack is used with the transmitter to get the dart exploded positions from the normal values. The actual position of the object's vertices are still stored within the position embedding.

## Usage

Use `startnet` in a Jerboa console to start the server. Then run the script from within Blender.

## Example of results

![A 3-G-map](example.stl "A 3-G-map")
